# mp_mapvote

Black Ops 1 map vote ( .menu file )

This was my first attempt at ever making a mapvote, it worked perfectly fine in private match-- however, server script errors are a bitch. It has the inner workings to create a "Choose Next Map" button for VIP players and it can also be used for voting of other things such as gamemode, pretty easily. Provide credit if you use this please.
